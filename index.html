                <body>Over the summer I decided to not go back to my part-time minimum wage job. Instead I started selling books and clothes that I bought at thrift stores online. This became a really fun and easy way to make money. It was also very flexible during covid.

        <body> Right before the shut down I was able to go to the Big 12 tournament in KC. We watched Oklahoma State play Iowa State, and they won. They would have then played Kansas, but before that could happen the world basically came to an end. </body>
